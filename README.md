# Collision-Detection-and-Prevention-System
We are aware of the fact that for every vehicle there exists a blind spot toward the left back end of the driver. That region is highly prone to collision . our proposed model provides a solution to this problem . The model consist of ultrasonic sensors which would send signal to arduino. The two sensors are placed at a particular angle. Each sensor has a sender and a receiver. The sensor sends waves from the sender side which when strikes an obstacle returns back and is captured by the receiver. The receiver sends the message to the arduino in which the code has been fed to transmit the signal to the buzzer which makes sound with different frequencies depending on the direction of the obstacle. The information from the arduino will also be transferred to the the I2C module which would forward it to the 16*2 LCD. The LCD displays the distance of the obstacle.
The additional feature of our model is the SOS touch sensor which would display an emergency message on the LCD. The model is a prototype and future enhancements like magnitude factor of impact , camera module, GPS module could be made . Strong sensors could be used for having large scale implementations maybe on an airplane for detecting birds or any on the obstacle on the runway.
